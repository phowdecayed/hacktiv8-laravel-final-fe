# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive backend administration interface for the ecommerce platform. The interface will serve as a management dashboard for backend users (Admin, Editor, Moderator) to efficiently manage products, categories, transactions, users, and monitor system activities through audit trails. The interface will be built using Vue 3 with TypeScript and will integrate with the existing Laravel API backend.
